  According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI), 1 in 5 U.S. adults, and 1 in 6 U.S. youths of ages 6-17 experience mental illness every year, with the issue of depression being one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Millions of people are affected by mental conditions ranging from mild to severe, from barely noticeable to greatly reducing the quality of life. No matter how “strong” you believe you are, your own mental health should be important to you; just like physical health, you need to take care of it. Here are a few ways to improve your mental health throughout your life:

    <li>Take some time to wind down and destress - even if you have a lot of work, taking some time for yourself can improve your mood and the quality of your work.
  </li>
    <li>Make sure to drink enough water, and get enough sleep, every day. Your physical health is just as important as your mental health, and being physically healthy can improve your mood.
  </li>
    <li>Try to find the silver lining in anything that brought down your mood recently.
  </li>
  <li>Relax in a warm bath or take a calming walk outside at least once a week to clear your mind. Meditation and yoga also work perfectly to clear your mind as well, and can be done whenever you feel overwhelmed.
  </li>
  <li> Go off the grid and enjoy your life in the moment: smile and laugh and have fun! You deserve it :)

  Sometimes, it’s not just our own selves that need help. Do you wonder how you would treat or talk to someone who you know, or suspect, to be struggling with their mental health? Whether that person is temporarily stressed due to a rough patch of time in their life, or continuously having trouble managing their mental health, here are some pieces of advice to follow when talking to them:
  </h3>

  <center> <span class = "icon" > <i class="fas fa-spa"></i> </span> </center>
  <br>
  <h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Don’t make a big deal out of it. They may feel like it is a private part of their life, or something that they are the only ones who know how to deal with. Instead, make sure they know that you understand how they feel, and give them suggestions like therapy if you believe they need it.
  </li>
    <li>Do NOT call them crazy, unnatural, or say that they just need to “get over it.” Those are some of the most harmful and insensitive things one can tell another person. They are a human being like you, who has a different life experience and a different perspective. Support them however you can but don’t drag them down just because you find them different.
  </li>
    <li>If you are having a serious heart-to-heart conversation because of a recent event or revelation about their mental state, take some time off your schedule to support them. Let them share as much or as little as they want to. If they want to share their problems, let them, and if they want help in solving them, try to help them. Never push them beyond how far they’re willing to go.
  </li>
  <li>Try to keep your questions open-ended rather than making blunt statements. For example, a “How do you feel”, sounds better than a “You don’t look so good”. In addition to this make sure to try to keep yourself and your words neutral and not grill the other with questions.
  </li>
  <li>Do not try to diagnose or make assumptions about their feelings or words. If you feel like they are in immediate danger or need outside help, avoid confrontation, ask if there is anyone they would like to contact, and reach out to people who are able to help with the situation.
  </li>
