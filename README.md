Team 28: Upasana Puranik, Onuva Ekram, Katie Li.
We created a website called the "Cognitive Cavern".
contains a matrix to type in daily tasks,
a checklist to check off how many things you did today to improve mental health,
a quiz to see how mentally aware you are,
and a learn more page to understand more about what you can do to help yourself and others struggling with mental health
