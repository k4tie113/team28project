# Cognitive Cavern (team 28 project)
Team 28: Upasana Puranik, Onuva Ekram, Katie Li. “Cognitive Cavern” is a user-interactive website we created which includes the “Mindful Matrix", a to-do list implementing the Eisenhower method to manage one's stress. It also contains a checklist to gauge a daily care routine for mental health, a Quiz to test of mentally aware you are, and finally a Learn More Page to understand more about what you can do to help yourself and others struggling with mental health.
