Upasana Puranik, Onuva Ekram, Katie Li
we created a website called the "cognitive cavern"
contains a matrix to type in daily tasks
a checklist to check off how many things you did today to improve mental health
a quiz to see how mentally aware you are
and a learn more page to understand more about what you can do to help yourself and others struggling with mental health
